# Project: [TITLE]

## Overview
[One-sentence description of the paper.]

## Build system
- `make` rebuilds the full pipeline (only stale targets)
- `make clean && make` reproduces everything from scratch
- `make sync` pushes updated tables/figures/bib to Overleaf
- `make paper` compiles the PDF locally (optional; can compile on Overleaf)

## Directory structure
```
data/raw/         ← Original data (never modified; .gitignored)
data/derived/     ← Cleaned datasets (generated by code; .gitignored)
data/simulated/   ← Synthetic data for testing without real data
code/             ← Numbered scripts: 01_clean, 02_analysis, etc.
code/_config.do   ← Stata path/settings (runs at top of every .do file)
code/libraries/   ← Bundled Stata ado files, renv lockfile, etc.
output/tables/    ← .tex fragments (never edit by hand)
output/figures/   ← .pdf figures (never edit by hand)
paper/            ← LaTeX manuscript, .bib, appendix
```

## Key conventions
- Scripts are numbered sequentially (01_, 02_, ...) to show execution order
- All .tex table files are fragments (no preamble) loaded via \input{}
- Figures are always PDF for vector quality
- Stata logs land in code/*.log — check these for debugging
- The Makefile handles OS detection for Stata paths (WSL vs native Linux)

## Common tasks for Claude Code
- "Run make --dry-run and tell me which targets are stale"
- "Read code/02_analysis.log and diagnose the error"
- "Add a new Makefile target for code/05_robustness.do"
- "Update README.md to reflect the current pipeline"
- "Check that all \input{} references in paper/main.tex have matching files"
